2witter doubles Twitter's character limit of 140. Tweet 280 characters at a time for your 2witter-using friends to read!
Ever need to tweet something that can't be summed up in 140 characters? It's happened to us, that's why we designed 2witter!

2witter is a new chrome plugin designed to increase the maximum character limit that Twitter enforces. With 2witter, you can send tweets of 280 characters! Upon tweeting, your message is encoded in up to 140 unicode characters.

2witter only encodes your tweets when they have exceeded the maximum limit. Any tweet 140 characters or shorter will be untouched by 2witter, and will be viewable by all of your followers.

To use 2witter, just install, go to twitter.com, and begin typing a long tweet from the homepage. Once you've written a tweet, and the limit is anything larger than -140, click tweet (it'll be grayed out, don't worry), and your tweet should be compressed and tweeted!

Only other users of 2witter will be able to view these tweets. They'll appear as symbols to anyone who isn't using the plugin, so tell your followers to get with the times and upgrade their twitter experience!


Be wary, 2witter only supports ASCII characters for now. ASCII characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and all basic keyboard punctuation.

In the future, we will probably provide support for some advanced unicode characters, it's a work in progress so please be patient.

2witter is currently in the google chrome store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/2witter/emlidmddcdcjgepdkfkniagbanpcebie?hl=en&gl=US
